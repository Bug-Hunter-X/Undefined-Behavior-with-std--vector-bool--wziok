This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the std::vector<bool> specialization in C++.  The bug.cpp file shows code that might result in undefined behavior due to how std::vector<bool> is implemented. The bugSolution.cpp offers a safer alternative.  For more details on the intricacies of this specialization, refer to the C++ documentation and related discussions on this topic.  Avoid using std::vector<bool> unless absolutely necessary; consider using alternatives such as std::vector<char> or a custom bitset for better control and predictability.
